        <h2>1.1 - What is the purpose of IT in modern business<hr></h2>
        <p>IT can be used for modern business in many ways. For example they can be used for data analysis, to track how customers are using or interacting with the business, how much money is being earned, spent etc., how the company is progressing and what changes can be made to improve it. IT can also be used to create user friendly websites and apps for the company to display what they do, and to process payments.

        <br>
        In fact, many companies can become completely IT based. Many financial companies are already harnessing IT. These companies are known as "Fintech’s" combining “finance” and “technology”; they harness technology to enhance or automate financial services and processes.</p>

        <h2>1.3 - Planing and carrying out tasks using IT<hr></h2>
        <p>To plan my website I used a <a href="https://trello.com/b/Us9vrAA6/mymockweb"target=_blank>trello board</a> to first define all the tasks that need to be completed. Once I have a clear idea of what I am doing I would then use the board to keep track of where I am up to.</p>

        <p> They have helped me in many ways. Trello was great for keeping track of everything, VS Code was great, as it gave me all the information necessary to correctly type the code, and format the pages as I wanted, with minimal stress. Slack was great for receiving links to pages that i would otherwise would have to find myself, and just keep in contact with the people I needed to.</p>
