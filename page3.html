        <h2>3.1 - Could I have been more efficient?<hr></h2>
        <p>I was constantly changing my mind about the design, so I was always redoing and reviewing my code, which was very time consuming and inefficient. Having a clear plan phase before any actual coding is a very important thing for efficient work. Doing this in a team is very helpful in that respect. However working alone has its advantages, for example, to be flexible is much easier alone, as opposed to a group, where flexibility is much more difficult. Overall I am not sure which of the two I would prefer.</p>

        <h2>3.2 - Ways to improve productivity and efficiency<hr></h2>
        <p>Having a plan phase before, where you decide on a web design and layout, maybe draw it on a paper, make sketches. Once that is done, making a realistic timetable for each specific aspect of the page when it should be completed. Make the HTML in stages and sections, using the “div” syntax, and update the CSS together with each section. This, and if you’re a team, constant meetings and updates, should help making the website a lot easier.</p>

        <h2>3.3 - What would I do differently next time?<hr></h2>
        <p>I would definitely put more work into planning the design, layout and style of the website before starting the code, so I know in advance exactly what type of “div’s” I would need. I would also take each and every step separately, with its own set of research and testing, so that it would be easier to handle it all, and focus on every small detail.</p>

    <div id="para1">
        <h2>3.4 - Testing digital solutions<hr></h2>
        <p>I would be constantly testing and retesting the website, and each digital solution, as they are being made. However once any particular section is finished, I would then get someone else to try the website, and test its functionality and user friendliness. Once I have feedback I would improve and update, repeating the cycle, until its complete. Once the website is done I would get a few more people to test it, and update it accordingly.</p>
