    <h1>About</h1>
    <div id="about">
        <p>My name is Chaim, and I was recently introduced to a wonderful coding course, to learn coding from scratch. The course I took was extremely good, and very enjoyable, I would definitely <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">recommend it</a>. I feel that IT is especially important right now, and I am excited and motivated to do it. Especially considering that IT can be used for virtually any idea, concept, or company, it can be used in endless ways, which makes me very excited. Its not like a routine job, there is really many different aspects, which I enjoy. This was true before I got into coding, and now that I have taken a course, I am even more excited about it.</p>
