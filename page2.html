        <h2>2.1 - Was I happy with tools I used?<hr></h2>
        <p>I was very pleased with the tools I used. Trello is very user friendly, and very detailed with numerous features, to keep track of all the tasks, exactly what needs to be done, how urgent it is, who is doing it (if used for a group), etc. Visual Studio Code, or VS Code, is very helpful, it is very efficient, it understands and auto completes syntax.</p>

        <h2>2.2 - Were the IT tools used appropiate?<hr></h2>
        <p>They are very appropriate for the reasons mentioned above. VS code is great, even for beginners, whilst not limiting a beginner to beginner code, it offers an advanced version even to those just starting.</p>

        <h2>2.4 - Improvments I would like to make<hr></h2>
        <p>Maybe integrating some back-end languages, like Python, to make the website more interactive. Another thing I would have liked to do maybe make the theme of the website different, more of a cartoony style, although I am pleased with the theme chosen. Another thing would be a drop down navbar, with options in each item on the navbar.</p>

    <div id="para1">
        <h2>2.3 - Am I pleased with my project?<hr></h2>
        <p>I am pleased with the final project, although it is pretty basic, I think it is expected for a first website, there is always room to improve, so this especially true with this being my first website. Things I would like to add in future projects, would be more research on the capabilities of CSS design, to be able use CSS for many more cool features.</p>

        <h2>2.5 - Website requirement review<hr></h2>
        <p>The assignment to make this website was to apply a few basic features to the website. These were, to make a Navigation bar, include a link in one of the articles, and style each webpage. Also included was to use a "class" syntax and an "id" ayntax for my CSS. All of these were met, and I put in some extra CSS into the navigation bar, so that it changes colour when hovering on a particular button, and that the page you are on has its own colour.</p>
