        <h2>Overview of the content and layout of the website<hr></h2>
        <p>The content of this website is a general overview of what I would do to create a website, how I have created this one, what I have learnt from making my very first website, and how I can improve:<br><br>
            - The first page is just a little bit about me.<br>
            - Outcome 1 is what I knew about this project, and IT projects in general, before I started making this website.<br>
            - Outcome 2 is how I felt during the project about the route I had taken in making this website, once I started applying it.<br>
            - Outcome 3 is a Review after completing the website.<br><br>
        The layout is pretty classic. The content is divided into questions, each question is in it's own box, and using CSS I designed them.

        <h2>Copyright and other constraints affecting websites<hr></h2>
        <p>Copyright is the right of someone who creates an original image. As soon as an image is created it has copyright and the person who created it owns the rights to that image. Only the owner has the right to reproduce the  work, display the work in public and copy the work or sell copies of the work to other people. The same applies to programs, you must create your own.

        <h2>Access issues<hr></h2>
        <p>Access issues could include people with disabilities, and therefore make it difficult for them to navigate your website. A basic example is someone who is blind, to make a website accessible to them, you could make effects for navigation. You could make auto answers to select from to enable a mouse only website, to navigate easier.</p>

        <h2>Appropriate filetypes<hr></h2>
        <p>For this website, all I used was one CSS file, for the layout and design of the webste. I used 5 HTML pages, one for each page of the website, and jpg files for the images, although other image files are also usable. Pyhton or JS files could also be used to make a more dynamic website.
